Rules of Reducers

-must return eny vale besides 'undefinved'
-produces 'state' or data to be used inside of your app usin only
previous state and the action (reducers are pure)
-must not return reach 'out itself' to tecide what value to
return 
-must not mutate its input 'state' argument


reducers are called first time when application is open
so because is not assign default value it will recive 
return undefined

bad code in reducer dont mutate state
state[0] = 'something'
state.pop()
state.push()

state.name = "something"

strings are imutable;
so if reducer return string or number you cant mutate it
dont worry
