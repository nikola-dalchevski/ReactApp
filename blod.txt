General Data Loading with Redux

-components get rendered onto the screen
-Component didMountMethod is called
-we call action creator from componentDidMount
-action creator runs code to make an api request
-api respons with data
-action creator return action with data that we fetch
-some reducer sees the action and returns the data 
-because we generated some new state objec our React app 
will be rerendered

--------------------
action with api request


badApproach
export cont fetchSomething = async () => {
    const response = await axios.get(url);

   return {
    type: "Something",
    payload: response
  }
}

Good approach install redux-thunk

Whats wrong with it?
-Action creator must return plain Js object with a type property
-the time our action gets to reducer we wont have fetched data

because we use async await 
whan buble compales there is swithc and case 0 is called our call method
if we dont use async data will be late

if we have middelware dispatch sand to middelwared after that in the reducer

import applyMiddleware from 'redux';
import thunk from 'redux-thunk';
second argument in createStore(reducers, applyMiddleware(thunk));


export cont fetchSomething = async (dispatch) => {
    const response = await axios.get(url);

   dispatch({type:"SOMETHING", payload: response})
}
