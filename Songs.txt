action creator 

const soSmething(){
   return {
     type: SOMTHING,
     pyload: {
       name: 'Nikola',
       phone: 32874924
       }
     }
  }

function that return a object (Action) who must have a propery type
and can have a second propery payload that is our app data;
---------------------------------------------------

Reducer 

const someReducer = (previusState = null, action) => {
 if(action.type == "SOMETHING"){
      return action.payload
   }  
  return previusStatee
}

Reducer takes two arguments previus state and action
chek if action type is something and if it so it returns the new state
else will return previus state
------------------------------
Redux Libery

import { combineReducers } from 'redux'

combineReducers({
   somereducer : somereducer,
})

export default reducers;

------------------------------------------
import { createStore } from "redux"

createStore(reducers)

store.dispatch(action);

store.getstate();

-----------------

React redux

Provider - top level wraper that get store as props

in index.js 

wrap app whit provider

<Provider store={ createStoere(reducers)}>

------------------------
connect

import { connect } from 'react-redux'

const mapStateToProps = state => {
  return { songs: state.songs };
};

export default connect(mapStateToProps)(componentName);

what mapStateToProps return a owr component will recive as porps

connect can take second parameter action that we import

import { action } from 'components/actions'

export default connect(mapStateToProps, {
     nameAction: nameAction,
})

now component will recive the action as props 
(and we can call on some event)

if we call action that we import direcly will be called as regular function
because we never refer her to reducers as action creator.
is posible to call the function and return action and after that call dispatch manualy;
when we call actions as connect argument than automaticly is called dispatch



Building Order

-make action creators
-make reducers
-import and install provider
-add porps to provider create store(combine reducers)
-import connect in component call mapStateToProps and action creators
