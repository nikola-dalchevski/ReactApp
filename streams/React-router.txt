react-router
react-router-dom // this is what we use
react-router-native
react-router-redux


import { BrowserRouter, Route} from 'react-router-dom'

<BrowserRouter>
<Route path="/pageName" component={componentName}

-react router see only characters after domain name
-you can have multiple route components with same path and component
-will be shown all routes that are contain in the url not only one;
-exact means that component will be shown only if the path is same with the url

Bad practice

dont use traditional html a tag with href attribute

<a href="/pagetwo">Go to page two<a/>

loads index.html evry time and dumps the data end fetch all data again

Right way

<Link to="/pageName">go to page<Link/>

Link is rendered also as a tag

but dont dumps data ande make new requests

if we put component inside in the BrowserRouter without route it will be 
visible all the time
